### Requirements:
###### NodeJS
 - npm
 - node


 Nodejs is the runtime (similar to the Java Runtime JRE). It allows Javascript to be executed from the command line. Facebook, for example, is built on NodeJS.

 Installing nodejs on windows is described here: https://www.ionos.de/digitalguide/websites/web-entwicklung/einfuehrung-in-nodejs/
 You don't need to follow the whole tutorial, just make sure that node and npm work as commands from the command line.

You can test your install with ```node -v``` and ```npm -v``` which should give you the installed versions as an output. If that works, you installed successfully.

###### IDE (Integrated development environmen => Entwicklungsumgebung)
I would recommend Atom(https://atom.io/) by Github, since it is very light weight and made for web (JS, html and so on) development. It can be extended with numerous modules and of course be used for a lot more then just JavaScript.

An IDE is basically a fancy notepad, which shows the file structure of your project, as well as highlights the code and potential errors.




###### Running the test app

I would suggest that you just take my example and play around inside of the index.js file. So you can concentrate on writing code and not setting up a project to begin with.


- run ```npm install ``` (Normally this would create the dependencies (imported packages created by other developers) in this case nothing really happens since we don't have any dependencies)
- run ```npm run start``` This looks in the package.json file (line 8) and executes the code that is behind the alias 'start'


##### To continue learning
I would recommend codeacacemy (it is free for a lot of courses, although you need to register an account) The JavaScript course is quite nice to start with. I think you should only work on one course at the time to not confuse yourself.

Otherwise https://phaser.io/ is an easy to use game framework that is very well documented with tons of examples.
